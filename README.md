# combat-template-cleanup
Provides a quick means to remove templates soon after placing them in combat.

# Installation
1. Inside Foundry's Configuration and Setup screen, go to **Add-on Modules**
2. Click "Install Module"
3. In the Manifest URL field paste: `https://github.com/Kekilla0/combat-template-cleanup/raw/master/module.json`

# Usage
Once activated in the module menu, after a user places a template on the next turn a dialog will ask if they would like to remove the template. At the end of each round the dialog will show again allowing the user to remove or keep the dialog.
